#' @title Featurized accelerometry data on 16 subjects with state information
#' @description A dataset containing featurized accelerometry data on 16
#'    subjects wearing waist accelerometers. Featurization was done by passing
#'    the raw data through the $\code{\link{transform}} function. State
#'    data was obtained through analysis of video footage of the subjects
